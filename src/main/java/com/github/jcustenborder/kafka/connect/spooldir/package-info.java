@Introduction("\n" +
    "This Kafka Connect connector provides the capability to watch a directory for files and " +
    "read the data as new files are written to the input directory. Each of the records in the " +
    "input file will be converted based on the user supplied schema.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "The CSVRecordProcessor supports reading CSV or TSV files. It can convert a CSV on the fly " +
    "to the strongly typed Kafka Connect data types. It currently has support for all of the " +
    "schema types and logical types that are supported in Kafka Connect. If you couple this " +
    "with the Avro converter and Schema Registry by Confluent, you will be able to process " +
    "CSV, Json, or TSV files to strongly typed Avro data in real time.")
